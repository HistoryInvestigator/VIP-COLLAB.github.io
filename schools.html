<h>What is student residency fraud?</h>
<p>Student residency fraud occurs when a student is being educated by a school or district that the student does not reside in causing an imbalance of funds generated by taxation against funds spent to provide educational services.</p>
<p>There are many reasons parents or guardians attempt to commit residency fraud. Some school districts have higher rated educational programs, some spend more money per student, and some have better sports programs. It is often common to see parents who have moved to try to keep students in a prior district in an attempt to keep them with known friends or teachers.</p>
<p>Some of the most common cases of residency fraud occur when a parent lies about their current address to have a student placed in a particular school district. The parent may even go as far as providing false or forged documentation to the district at the time of enrollment. Many larger districts do not have the time or resources to fully investigate or verify each student that enrolls so the fraud gets caught up in the shuffle and is never discovered.</p>

<h>Why use Respect?</h>
<p>School districts usually hire private investigators to respond to tips about a student who does not live in their district, which is expensive, time consuming, and reactive. The average cost of a student is $11,392/year per the census and if this person is attending a school where they do not reside in the district, then it costs the school money.
We give the school for a more proactive, preventative option that will lower the cost of research a PI needs to do if later hired, and expedites the decision process.</p>
